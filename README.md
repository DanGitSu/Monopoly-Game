Assignment-1 Application Programming

Games Kiosk â€“ A Board Game Renting System

You are a Software Engineer at a game design company and you have been asked to write the software for their latest piece of technology, a fully automated board game renting system.

This is one of the latest strategies implemented by the company that aims to increase profits and makes their products more accessible to their customer base.

However, they are struggling to find a capable programmer that can build a robust application that is fully functional and easy to use.

This requirement is urgent, as competitor companies have heard the rumours of this state-of-the-art system and they have also started working on similar prototypes.
